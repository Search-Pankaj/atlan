# Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue 1: Frontend Accessibility

### Symptoms
- The frontend service is not accessible externally after deployment.

### Diagnosis
1. **Check Ingress Configuration**:
   - Ensure the Ingress rule matches the correct host and path.
   - Verify the Ingress controller is correctly set up and running.
2. **Check Service Status**:
   - Ensure the frontend service is exposing port 80 and is reachable.
3. **Check DNS Resolution**:
   - Ensure `frontend.example.com` resolves to the Ingress controller's IP.

### Resolution
- Correct any misconfigurations in the Ingress rules or service annotations.
- Ensure the domain resolves correctly.

## Issue 2: Intermittent Backend-Database Connectivity

### Symptoms
- Backend services occasionally lose connection to MongoDB, causing request failures.

### Diagnosis
1. **Inspect Network Policies**:
   - Ensure there are no restrictive network policies blocking traffic.
2. **Service Discovery**:
   - Validate that the backend services are resolving the MongoDB service name correctly.
3. **MongoDB Logs**:
   - Check for any errors or warnings in the MongoDB logs.

### Resolution
- Adjust network policies or service configurations as necessary.
- Ensure the MongoDB StatefulSet is healthy and appropriately scaled.

## Issue 3: Order Processing Delays

### Symptoms
- Users report delays in order processing, likely related to RabbitMQ.

### Diagnosis
1. **Check RabbitMQ Metrics**:
   - Analyze the queue lengths and consumer processing times.
2. **Inspect Logs**:
   - Look for any errors or bottlenecks in RabbitMQ or the backend services.

### Resolution
- Tune RabbitMQ configurations for optimal performance.
- Consider scaling RabbitMQ consumers if the load is high.
